<h2> Details of the Three Calendars </h2>

<p> His Majesty's Government recognises three calendars for official use in the kingdom, as follows. All dates are reckoned with respect to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and assume a position on the earth's surface of 0&#176;N 0&#176;E. </p>

<h3> The Cyprian Calendar </h3>

<p> The <strong>Cyprian Calendar</strong> is the primary calendar of the kingdom. It is used mostly when dating formal and legal documents. </p>

<p> The Cyprian Calendar is essentially the Hebrew or Jewish calendar, with the following modifications: </p>

<ul>
<li> The usual twelve months are renamed, from the earliest (formerly Nisan) to the latest (formerly Adar): Primilis, Sectilis, Tertilis, Qartilis, Quintilis, Sextilis, September, October, November, December, Unodecember, Duodecember. </li>
<li> Instead of the system in the Hebrew calendar where, when an intercalary month needs to be added to a year, the month of Adar is replaced with the months I Adar and II Adar, the new month of Intercalaris is inserted between Duodecember and the following year's Primilis. </li>
</ul>

<h3> The Gregorian Calendar </h3>

<p> The <strong>Gregorian Calendar</strong> is a secondary calendar of the kingdom, but it is used more frequently than the other two, due to its widespread use throughout the world. </p>

<h3> The Sacred Calendar </h3>

<p> The <strong>Sacred Calendar</strong> is another secondary calendar of the kingdom. It is used for calculating seasons and feasts relating to the Christian religion. </p>

<p> The Sacred Calendar is a simplified version of the liturgical calendar of the Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic Church. More specifically, with respect to important days:</p>

<ul>
<li> Advent Sunday falls on the fourth Sunday before Christmas; </li>
<li> Christmas falls on the twenty-fifth day of December in the Gregorian Calendar; </li>
<li> Epiphany falls on the first Sunday following New Year's Day of the Gregorian Calendar; </li>
<li> Easter falls on the day on which it is determined to fall by the Bishop of Rome; </li>
<li> Ash Wednesday falls exactly forty-six days before Easter; </li>
<li> Palm Sunday falls on the Sunday before Easter; </li>
<li> Maundy Thursday falls on the Thursday before Easter; </li>
<li> Good Friday falls on the Friday before Easter; </li>
<li> Ascension falls on the sixth Thursday after Easter; </li>
<li> Pentecost falls on the seventh Sunday after Easter (not including Easter itelf); </li>
<li> All Saints' Day falls on the first day of November in the Gregorian Calendar; </li>
<li> All Souls' Day falls on the second day of November in the Gregorian Calendar. </li>
</ul>

<p> With respect to seasons: </p>

<ul>
<li> Advent lasts from dawn on Advent Sunday until sunset on the day before Christmas; </li>
<li> Christmas lasts from sunset on the day before Christmas until sunset on Epiphany; </li>
<li> The first period of Ordinary Time lasts from sunset on Epiphany until dawn on Ash Wednesday; </li>
<li> Lent lasts from dawn on Ash Wednesday until dawn on Easter; </li>
<li> Holy Week lasts from dawn on Palm Sunday until dawn on Easter; </li>
<li> The season of Easter lasts from dawn on Easter until sunset on Pentecost; </li>
<li> The second period of Ordinary Time lasts from sunset on Pentecost until dawn on Advent Sunday. </li>
</ul>

<p> With respect to colours: </p>

<ul>

<li> The colour of Advent is violet; </li>
<li> The colour of Christmas is white; </li>
