<p> Please note: this search will only look through the site's database. For material on static pages --- there <br/>
are less than a dozen of them --- you'll have to read through these manually. </p>

<p> Also, this search will only look for exact matches of whatever string of characters you enter. We can't handle <br/>
anything more complicated just yet. </p>

<p> Finally, you should only enter letters, numbers and spaces. No ', ", %, $, etc. No funny business! </p>
